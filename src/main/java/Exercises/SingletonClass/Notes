SINGLETON CLASS:

-> A class whose only one object can be created at any given time is Singleton class.

==> Two steps to achieve singleton class.
    1. Make a constuctor private.
    2. Create a static method which return instance/object of the class.
        -> Use if condition to check if object has been created already or not.
        -> If object has not been created then create a object and return for the first time.
        -> If object has already been created then return the same created object
            and does not create a new object.

==> FOR EG:

    public class Singleton {

    private static Singleton singletonObject = null;

    private Singleton(){
    }

    public static Singleton getSingletonObject(){
        if(singletonObject==null)
            singletonObject = new Singleton();

        return singletonObject;
    }

    public void printMessage(){
        System.out.println("This is PrintMessage() in singleton class");
    }

}
